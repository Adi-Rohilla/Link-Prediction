# Link-Prediction
A project to predict the chances of a person to be diagnosed with a genetic disease using the Firefly Algorithm.

## Introduction 
Firefly Algorithm is based on the flashing patterns and behavior of fireflies. This algorithm uses the following three idealized rules: 

* Fireflies are unisex so that one firefly will be attracted to other fireflies regardless of their sex.

* The attractiveness is proportional to the brightness and they both decrease as their distance increases.Thus for any two flashing fireflies, the less bright one
will move towards the brighter one. If there is no brighter one than a particular firefly, it will move randomly.

* The brightness of a firefly is determined by the landscape of the objective function. 

In this project, the brightness of a firefly or a node is regarded to be binary, i.e., the firefly is either luminous or it is not.
The person is either diagnosed with the disease or not.
